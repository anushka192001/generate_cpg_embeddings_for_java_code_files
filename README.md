# generate_cpg_embeddings_for_java_code_files
this project generates cpg embeddings of each java code file by extracting graph like information from each of the java code files.  it uses ast_embeddings of each line as vertices and cfg and pdg  relation between each of these lines as edges. for further information  please follow  .readme file.
